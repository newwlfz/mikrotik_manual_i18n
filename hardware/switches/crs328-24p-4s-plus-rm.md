All MikroTik devices must be professionally installed.

## Quickstart

- Connect with your PC to any Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open [https://192.168.88.1](https://192.168.88.1) in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and it can be mounted in a rackmount enclosure using provided rack mounts, or it can be placed on the desktop. Please attach rubber pegs on the bottom of the router if the desired placement is on the flat surface or use a Phillips screwdriver to attach rackmount ears on both sides of the device if designated use is for rackmount enclosure:

- Attach rack ears to both sides of the device and tighten four screws to secure them in place, as shown in the picture.

- Place the device in the rackmount enclosure and align with the holes so that the device fits conveniently.
- Tighten screws to secure it in place. The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment. We recommend Cat6 cables for our devices. Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.

## Powering

The unit is equipped with one IEC type AC power input, which accepts 100-240 V **⏦** powering (~ 50/60 Hz 7 A max). The power consumption of this device itself under maximum load is up to 44 W.

## Configuration

Full documentation for both RouterOS and SwOS is available at: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) You can configure the device using WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.** **To start setup, open [https://192.168.88.1](https://192.168.88.1) in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use WinBox and choose the "Neighbors" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "admin", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker). The device is equipped with an RJ45 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the Reset button.

The device supports booting either RouterOS (for full routing and switching functionality) or SwOS (for switch-only operation). By default, the device boots into RouterOS, but you can switch to the other operating system as follows:

- From SwOS: Go to the System menu and click the Boot RouterOS button at the bottom of the page.
- From RouterOS: Open System → RouterBOARD → Settings and select Boot OS. It is also possible to choose the operating system and configure other boot options using the serial console menu.

## Power output

This device can supply PoE powering to external devices from its Ethernet ports. The output voltage will be selected automatically, depending on what kind of voltage the connected device requires. The device can power both 802.3af/at devices and devices that accept passive PoE power. If necessary, the output voltage can be switched manually. By default the PoE mode is set to auto, it will not damage devices and will auto-detect devices with PoE support and the needed voltage. Once a PoE device is detected, it will be powered and the PoE LEDs will turn on. The PoE out ports is grouped in three PoE out groups of 8 ports each (PSE8). Total device PoE limit = 450w (150w per PSE8 group). Each port can provide up to 30 W with high voltage, and 26,5 W with low voltage power output.

## Buttons and jumpers

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USR LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds or until the user LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers. **The first Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility. Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery. **Mode button:** The action of the mode buttons can be configured from RouterOS software to execute any user-supplied RouterOS script. You can also disable this button. The mode button can be configured in RouterOS menu /system routerboard mode-button

## LED indicators

- PWR LED is lit when the router is powered on.
- The use of LEDs can be configured from RouterOS.
- Triangle LEDs (top row) indicate PoE out status. Green LED indicates that the respective port uses low voltage, a red LED indicates high voltage. Flashing single green LED: problem to start a low voltage device. Flashing single red LED: problem with high voltage device.
- The square port LEDs (bottom row) indicate the individual Ethernet, SFP port activity.
- FAN FAULT LED indicates a problem with any of the cooling fans.
- PoE FAULT LED indicates an exceeded overall max PoE output limit. Port PoE-out priorities will work in 3 independent sections (8 ports each) and overload will happen in any section that breach 150W consumption
