## [CRS305-1G-4S+IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs305_1g_4s_in)

This device is a 10 Gigabit SFP+ switch, powered by RouterOS. It features two redundant DC inputs. The device has four SFP+ cages (modules are not included) for high-performance 10GbE connectivity (1.25 Gbit modules are also supported) and a 1GbE copper port for management. The device is ready to use as a switch. See the [CRS305-1G-4S+IN product page](https://mikrotik.com/product/crs305_1g_4s_in) for full specifications and brochures.

## Quickstart

- Connect with your PC to any Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Use WebFig in a web browser or the "WinBox" configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the WebFig or WinBox "Files" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Mounting

This device is designed for use indoors by placing it on the flat surface or mounting on the wall when mounting on the wall, please ensure that cable feed is pointing downwards. We recommend using Cat5/6 shielded cable for our devices. The distance measured in mm.

## Powering

The device accepts powering from the two DC power jacks (redundancy fail-over) or from the first Ethernet port:

- Direct input power jacks DC1, DC2 (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive) accept DC ⎓ 12-57 V DC.
- The first Ethernet port accepts passive or 802.3af/at Power over Ethernet in the range of DC ⎓ 12-57 V. The power consumption of this device under maximum load with fiber SFP modules is 10 W when using all RJ10 copper modules, up to 18 W. When using 802.3af/at to power this device, we recommend not using grounding for best compatibility.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect an Ethernet cable from the device to the **PoE+DATA** **(PoE-out)** port of the PoE adapter.
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your local network (LAN) to the **DATA** port of the PoE adapter.
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, then plug it into a power outlet.

## Configuration

Full documentation for both RouterOS and SwOS is available at [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help). The device can be configured using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**

Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).

The device is equipped with an RS-232 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the Reset button.

The Marvell Prestera switch chip features are described in the [Marvell Prestera switch chip features](/docs/7.24/bridging-and-switching/marvell-prestera-switch-chip-features) manual.

The device supports booting either RouterOS (for full routing and switching functionality) or SwOS (for switch-only operation). By default, the device boots into RouterOS, but you can switch to the other operating system as follows:

- From SwOS: go to the **System** menu and click the "**Boot RouterOS**" button at the bottom of the page.
- From RouterOS: open **System → RouterBOARD → Settings** and select **Boot OS**.

It is also possible to choose the operating system and configure other boot options using the serial console menu.

## Extension slots and ports

- Four SFP+ cages, which accept both 1.25 Gb SFP and 10 Gb SFP+ modules.
- One Gigabit Ethernet port, suggested to be used for management (Supports Auto MDI/X so you can use either straight or cross-over cables for connecting to other network devices). The Ethernet port (ETH/BOOT) can also be used for network booting and recovery with Netinstall.

## Reset button

- To reset the configuration, unplug the device from power, press and hold the Reset button, and release it when the USER (USR) LED starts flashing.
- To load the backup bootloader, press and hold the Reset button before applying power, then release it after three seconds.
- To initiate the Netinstall process (booting the device in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS), press and hold the Reset button, power on the device, and wait for the USER (USR) LED to flash, then become stable. When the USR LED turns off, release the Reset button.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
