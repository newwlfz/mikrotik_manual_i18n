## Safety Warnings

Before you work on any equipment, be aware of the hazards involved with electrical circuitry, and be familiar with standard practices for preventing accidents. Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations. The Installation of the equipment must comply with local and national electrical codes. This unit is intended to be installed in the rackmount. Please read the mounting instructions carefully before beginning installation. Failure to use the correct hardware or to follow the correct procedures could result in a hazardous situation to people and damage to the system. This product is intended to be installed indoors. Keep this product away from water, fire, humidity, or hot environments. Use only the power supply and accessories approved by the manufacturer, which can be found in the original packaging of this product. Read the installation instructions before connecting the system to the power source. We cannot guarantee that no accidents or damage will occur due to the improper use of the device. Please use this product with care and operate at your own risk! In the case of device failure, please disconnect it from power. The fastest way to do so is by unplugging the power plug from the power outlet. It is the customer's responsibility to follow local country regulations, including operation within legal frequency channels, output power, cabling requirements, and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) requirements. All MikroTik devices must be professionally installed.

## Quickstart

- Download the latest SwitchOS software version from [https://mikrotik.com/download](https://mikrotik.com/download);
- Connect your computer to any of the ethernet ports;
- Connect the device to the power source;
- Set the IP address of your computer to 192.168.88.3;
- Open your Web browser, the default management IP address is 192.168.88.1, with the username **admin** and no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- Upload the file with the web browser to the Upgrade tab, the device will reboot after an upgrade;
- Set up your password to secure the device.

## Powering

The device accepts power from the power jack or from the AC source.

- Direct-input power jack (5.5mm outside and 2mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 48-57V DC.
- AC input range 100-240 V.
- Max power consumption (without attachments) 12 W.
- Max power consumption 162 W.

## PoE-Out

- PoE-Out 802.3 af/at and passive PoE
- PoE-Out ports ether1-ether8:PoE-Out voltage: low voltage 28V;
- high voltage 54V (AC input) or 48-57V (DC Input)
- Maximum low voltage PoE-Out output current: 1000 mA (per port).
- Maximum high voltage PoE-Out output current: 625 mA (per port).
- Total output power 140 W. PoE-Out high voltage varies depending on the power supply: if an AC power supply is used PoE-Out high voltage will always be ~54V; if a DC Jack power supply is used PoE-Out high voltage will match the input voltage on the DC Jack. PoE-Out low voltage is constant at ~28V. **if AC and DC power supplies are used simultaneously PoE-Out high voltage will depend on the higher input voltage. It will change only if the DC Jack input exceeds 54 volts.*

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE+DATA port of the PoE adapter.
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your local network (LAN) to the PoE adapter.
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## LED

The power supply will be determined by a device and given the appropriate Voltage if it's low the LED will light Green if the requirement is the high LED will light red, and none when no power is required for the client device.
