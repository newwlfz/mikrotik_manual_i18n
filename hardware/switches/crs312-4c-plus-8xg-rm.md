## Configuration

Full documentation for both RouterOS and SwOS is available at [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help). The device can be configured using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility.**

Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker).

The device is equipped with an RJ45 serial port, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. For recovery purposes, it is possible to reinstall the device from the network, see the Reset button.

The Marvell Prestera switch chip features are described in the [Marvell Prestera switch chip features](/docs/7.24/bridging-and-switching/marvell-prestera-switch-chip-features) manual.

The device supports booting either RouterOS (for full routing and switching functionality) or SwOS (for switch-only operation). By default, the device boots into RouterOS, but you can switch to the other operating system as follows:

- From SwOS: go to the **System** menu and click the "**Boot RouterOS**" button at the bottom of the page.
- From RouterOS: open **System → RouterBOARD → Settings** and select **Boot OS**.

## Combo interface

The four combo interfaces each have two physical connectors of which the only one can be used at the same time. The ports will be automatically represented as combo 1-4 in RouterOS. It is possible to select which physical port will be used in the RouterOS software ethernet menu. If left to default "auto", and both F/T have cables plugged in, SFP will take priority. For example, if you have plugged an Ethernet cable into the 1T port and an SFP module in the 1F port, you will have to choose in RouterOS which one to use. Double click the respective combo interface in RouterOS GUI to see which socket is used.

## Reset button

- To reset the configuration, unplug the device from power, press and hold the Reset button, and release it when the USER (USR) LED starts flashing.
- To load the backup bootloader, press and hold the Reset button before applying power, then release it after three seconds.
- To initiate the Netinstall process (booting the device in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS), press and hold the Reset button, power on the device, and wait for the USER (USR) LED to flash, then become stable. When the USR LED turns off, release the Reset button.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
