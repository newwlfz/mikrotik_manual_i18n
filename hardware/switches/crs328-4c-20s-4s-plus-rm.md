## Combo ports

The four combo interfaces each have two physical connectors of which only one can be used at the same time. The ports will be automatically represented as combo1-4 in the RouterOS. It is possible to select which physical port will be used in the RouterOS software Ethernet menu. If left to default "auto", and both F/T have cables plugged in, SFP will take priority. For example, if you have plugged an Ethernet cable into the 1T port and an SFP module in the 1F port, you will have to choose in RouterOS which one to use. Double click the respective combo interface in RouterOS GUI to see which socket is used.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and it can be mounted in a rackmount enclosure using provided rack mounts, or it can be placed on the desktop. Please attach rubber pegs on the bottom of the router if the desired placement is on the flat surface or use a Phillips screwdriver to attach rackmount ears on both sides of the device if the designated use is for rackmount enclosure:
