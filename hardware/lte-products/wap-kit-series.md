## Powering

**PoE Input**

The ethernet port accepts 9-30 V passive PoE power. The box contains a 24 V adapter and a PoE injector. Plug the included PoE injector into the first or internet port of the router that you will use in your LAN (or directly into your laptop) and attach an ethernet cable to the PoE injector. Connect the other end of this ethernet cable to the wAP LTE device. Plug the power supply into the PoE injector

**Power jack**

The DC jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside diameter, female, pin positive plug) supports 9-30 V power, the the device comes with a 24 V 1.2 A power adapter

**Automotive connector**

The automotive connector can be used to power the device from regular 12/24 V connections in automobiles and buses. The plug has four pins: bottom left (black) is the ground, bottom right is power in (red). The upper two are reserved for future use. Maximum power consumption at 24 V is 6 W without miniPCIe, and 8 W with a full load on the miniPCIe card.

## Mounting

The device can be mounted in several ways: pole, wall, ceiling or it can be placed in specially designed MikroTik holder which comes with the package. The package also includes a drill hole template with detailed mounting instructions, to help you with the Ethernet cable installation and attachment to a ceiling or a wall. Steel bracket to put on the other side of a dropdown ceiling tile and two screws and wall anchors. Zip ties or steel clamps for mounting on the pole. The IP rating scale for this device is IP54. When mounting outdoors, ensure that any cable openings are directed downwards. You should use the POE injector and proper grounding with Cat6 shielded cable. When using and installing this device pay attention to Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) safety distance with a minimum of 35 cm between the radiator and your body. **Mounting on the mast or pole:**

![](./img/worddav87ed2c7da078f68a3e635bdf96ad1bf5-e0c75f9136fc87fe3fdf.webp)

- Reassemble.

## Extension slots and ports

- Built-in 2 GHz wireless access point module, AP/station/bridge/p2p modes are supported.
- One 10/100 Ethernet port, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X). Either straightor crossover cable can be used for connecting to other network devices. The ethernet port accepts 9-30 VDC powering from a passive PoE injector.
- miniPCIe slot and SIM slot (can’t be used separately) to be used with a 3G/4G/LTE modem (some kitsinclude it).

## MiniPCIe slot usage

The device is equipped with a miniPCIe slot (a kit with preinstalled modem also available) to be used with a 3G/4G/LTE modem. A SIM slot is provided for use together with a miniPCIe modem. SIM slot is not used separately. To install the miniPCIe module, remove both screws below the power jack and slide out the wAP PCB board. Insert the miniPCIe modem, and secure it with two Philips screws which are already in place. Attach the grey uFL connector to the MAIN antenna connector of the modem, attach the black cable to the other (or AUX) connector. It is possible to use external antennas for the modem, two SMA mounting holes are provided next to the reset button, or if you prefer to attach antennas to the case directly, SMA antennas can be mounted on the bottom of the case if you remove the two plastic hole covers first. After you have reinserted the wAP board into the case and secured it with the screws that were removed earlier, slide in the SIM card from your mobile operator into the SIM slot, with the chip facing up. The slot accepts miniSIM (2FF). The SIM slot protects the SIM card from falling out with a plastic latch. You can press the latch and then pull the SIM out using tweezers or a similar tool.

## Buttons and jumpers

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total 10 seconds).
- Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers (total 15 seconds). Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Configuration

You should select the "Check for updates" button and update your RouterOS software to the latest version to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest visiting the RouterOS documentation page to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default). It is possible to boot the device from a network, for reinstalling RouterOS for recovery purposes. This can be done from the first Ethernet port. See above how to do this.
