The device can be used both indoors and outdoors. The IP rating scale of IP54. If you intend to mount outdoors, ensure that any cable openings are directed downwards. The Mounting direction is indicated on the device with an arrow pointing up. Use POE injector and proper grounding. Recommended using Cat6 shielded cable. Warning! This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 30 cm between the device and your body. Operation of this equipment in the residential environment could cause radio interference.

## Configuration

You should select the "Check for updates" button and update your RouterOS software to the latest version to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from a network, see the section .

## GPS

The built-in GPS module requires an external antenna to be used (SMA connector is already mounted behind the unit door). See the section on how to remove the door. **Attention** the GPS uses an active antenna, only connect and disconnect the antenna, when the device is turned off!

**Supports - GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo).** Make sure that the GPS package is installed on your device. Check by following command /system package print. If not installed download extra packages at our download page accordingly to your RouterOS version and install GPS package by dragging it to the Files menu. Enable GPS and start working:

- Enabling - /system gps set enable=yes;
- Setting antenna to external - /system gps set gps-antenna-select=external;
- Checking configuration - /system gps print. Configuration information - [GPS manual, basic examples](/docs/7.24/mobile-networking/gps/#basic-examples)

## Powering

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 12-30 V DC ⎓ with provided 24 V, 1.2 A adapter.
- Ethernet port accepts passive Power over Ethernet 12-30 V DC ⎓ (compensate for the loss on cable, so more than 12 V recommended).
- The automotive connector can be used to power the device from regular 12/24 V ⎓ connections in automobiles and buses. The plug has four pins: bottom left (black) is the ground, bottom right is power in (red). The upper two (AUX) are reserved for future use. The power consumption under maximum load can reach 12 W without attachments. Attach ground (earth) wire to the screw under the door.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter: (Not included)

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the POE out port of the POE adapter.
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN to the POE adapter.
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Front status LED behavior

## miniPCIe slot

### SIM card connectivity

- MiniPCIe 1 (top slot) supports PCIe and USB 2.0 cards but is shared with the USB 2.0 type A port (can use either the USB port or miniPCIe slot at the same time). It can be used only for SIM slot #1.
- MiniPCIe 2 (bottom slot) supports only USB (2.0 and 3.0) miniPCIe modems (no PCIe support). Uses SIM slot #2 and SIM slot #3. By default uses SIM slot #2.
- USB 2.0 type A port (can only be used if miniPCIe 1 is not used).
- To use the top miniPCIe slot with a USB type miniPCIe card, switch the USB connections to the miniPCIe slot: /system routerboard usb set type=mini-PCIe This will disable the USB 2.0 port on the front of the unit.
- Insert the SIM card into the top slot by a chip on the SIM card facing down. Bottom slots – with the chip facing up. check if you are using the correct SIM slot. For the modem inserted in the bottom mini-pcie slot, you need to use either sim slot 2 or sim slot 3. And the used sim slot needs to be selected in RouterOS. CLI command to select the sim slot: */system routerboard modem set sim-slot=2*

### Modem installation

This LtAP version is without a modem installed. In this case, an internal antenna is not connected. Installing a miniPCIe module should be done by a qualified person, follow safety precautions when handling electrical equipment, the device supports two LR cards:

- Use a wrist grounding strap when unpacking and working with electrical components to avoid electrical discharge (ESD) damage;
- Remove six screws on the bottom of the case and lift off the top part of the case.
- Locate the miniPCIe slot and remove two factory attached screws;
- Attach provided a thick thermal pad to the card, and install the card into miniPCIe slot so that thermal pad is between PCB and card;
- The secure card in place using previously removed two screws;
- Connect internal antenna cables to your modem. Or guide your antenna cables through openings near the GPS connector and connect to the modem. Recommended using silicone rubber to secure connectors in place.
- Attach a thinner thermal pad to the top of the card;
- When using external antennas, connectors can be attached on the case sides, to make openings use a 6.5 mm drill bit, see section part 4;
- see the picture below for reference on how to place rubber seals for best water protection;

![](./img/image-03bc3068.webp)

- Reassembly in backorder. Tightening torque for PCB screws 0.3 Nm, case cover/enclosure screws 0.5 Nm. After you have reinserted the device into the case and secured it with the screws that were removed earlier, slide in the SIM cards from your mobile operator into the SIM slots, with the chips facing as shown on the port label. The slot accepts miniSIM (2FF). SIM slots 2 and 3 apply to the bottom miniPCIe slot and can be switched in RouterOS "/system routerboard sim" menu.

## Reset button

- Hold this button during boot time until LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total 10 seconds).
- Or keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers (total 15 seconds). Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
