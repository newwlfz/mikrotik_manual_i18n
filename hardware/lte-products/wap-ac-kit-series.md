## SIM slot usage

![](./img/worddav1617cee4086cb64136be15fb67b20679-20df3939c52d6374dea1.webp)

SIM card slot is designed to use with Micro SIM cards. Nano SIM cards have different thickness, usage with adapter are not recommended.

## Buttons and jumpers

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration (total 5 seconds).
- Keep holding for 5 more seconds, LED turns solid, release now to turn on CAP mode. The device will now look for a CAPsMAN server (total 10 seconds).
- Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers (total 15 seconds). Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Configuration

You should select the "Check for updates" button and update your RouterOS software to the latest version to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest visiting the RouterOS documentation page to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case an IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default). It is possible to boot the device from a network, for reinstalling RouterOS for recovery purposes. This can be done from the first Ethernet port. See above how to do this.
