## Mounting

![](./img/api_rb912r-2nd-ltm.jpg)

- It is possible to attach the device to a wall, using the provided screw holes on the sides of the unit. The device should be mounted in a way that the cable openings are pointing downward as shown in the picture.
- The ports are protected with a small door, that is held in place with one screw. Use the Philips PH2 screwdriver to access the ports.
- The door has cut-out places for all available ports, but only break out the openings that you will use. The device can be used both indoors and outdoors. The IP rating scale for this device is IP54.
- The device enclosure has places where you can drill openings for external LTE and GPS antennas. Use a drill to make holes that are appropriate for the antenna cable used. Alternatively, you can obtain a "DINrail Pro" - mounting bracket, designed to fit standard 35 mm x 7.5 mm DIN rails. [https://mikrotik.com/product/dinrail_pro](https://mikrotik.com/product/dinrail_pro)

When mounting outdoors, ensure that any cable openings are directed downwards. Use a PoE injector and proper grounding. Recommended using Cat6 cable. *Warning! This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the device and your body. Operation of this equipment in the residential environment could cause radio interference.* *Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.*

## Powering

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin-positive plug) accepts 8-30 V DC.
- micro USB port accepts 5 V powering.
- Ethernet port accepts passive and 802.3af/at Power over Ethernet 8-57 V DC (compensate for the loss on cable, so more than 12 V recommended). The power consumption under maximum load with attachments can reach 9 W.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE+DATA port of the PoE adapter.
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your local network (LAN) to the PoE adapter.
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Extension slots and ports

![](./img/worddav88257375dc6fa627727b744f75769a22-cfcb6f1c127f63085ce1.webp)

- Built-in 2 GHz wireless access point module, AP/station/bridge/p2p modes are supported. Onboard PIF antennas built-in. Antenna gain1.5 dBi.
- miniPCIe slot and two SIM slots (can't be used without a modem installed, can't be used both at the same time) to be used with a 3G/4G/LTE modem. Onboard antennas are available, but openings for external antennas are provided on the case.
- Built-in GPS module - uFL connector provided for an external antenna. To enable, set the port to serial0 (this disables the DB9 port on the unit). Supports (GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo).
- One 10/100 Ethernet port, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X). Either straight or crossover cable can be used for connecting to other network devices. The Ethernet port accepts 12-57 V DC powering from a passive PoE injector.
- One DB9 RS232 serial port for serial console access. Configured as 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity. Can't be used if built-in GPS is enabled on serial0.
- One micro USB 2.0 port for powering only.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see section .

## miniPCIe slot usage

The device is equipped with a miniPCIe slot and a factory-installed LTE modem. Two SIM slots are provided for use together with a miniPCIe modem. The SIM slot is not used separately.

In this case, an internal antenna is connected to the modem. Replacing a miniPCIe module should be done by a qualified person, follow safety precautions when handling electrical equipment:- Use a wrist grounding strap when unpacking and working with electrical components to avoid electrical discharge (ESD) damage.

- Open the front cover by unscrewing one screw with the Philips PH2 screwdriver.
- Remove four screws on the bottom of the case and lift off the top part of the case. You will see the antenna attached to it.
- Locate the miniPCIe card on the PCB and remove two screws.
- Attach provided a thick thermal pad to the card, and install the card into miniPCIe slot so that the thermal pad is between PCB and card.
- The secure card in place using previously removed two screws.
- Attach the grey uFL connector to the MAIN antenna connector of the modem, and attach the black cable to the secondary (or AUX) connector.
- To use external antennas (not included), attach antenna connectors and use a 6.5 mm drill bit to drill holes on the side of the unit. (see "") description 4.
- see the picture below on how to place rubber seals for the best water protection.

![](./img/worddave58e08a9b209790f373a5352b3d5e635-fc07071199364953ebc1.webp)

- Attach antenna connectors to the installed card and GPS connector on the PCB, as additional rubber silicone can be used to secure connectors in place on the card and PCB board.

![](./img/worddav5f329faf991824f7b26b06ba7747d822-c9e55d5d902b4c5947ef.webp)

Attach a thinner thermal pad to the top of the card.

- Reassembly. After you have reinserted the device into the case and secured it with the screws that were removed earlier, slide in the SIM cards from your mobile operator into the SIM slots, with the chips facing as shown on the port label. The slot accepts miniSIM (2FF). Close the black latch for SIM cards, to secure them in the slots.

## GPS usage

In order to use GPS, an external antenna is needed to connect. Use the "ACGPSA" - can be obtained separately. ACGPSA is a standalone active GPS antenna, that works in the 1575.4 MHz spectrum. Antenna size is 46.5 mm x 26.5 mm x 12.5 mm with an IP67 rating and includes an internal magnet and double-sided tape, so it can easily be attached to various surfaces. It has a long 5m cable with an SMA connector, to be connected to LtAP mini via the ACSMAUFL pigtail (not included, product code ACSMAUFL) [https://mikrotik.com/product/acgpsa](https://mikrotik.com/product/acgpsa) [https://mikrotik.com/product/acsmaufl](https://mikrotik.com/product/acsmaufl) To connect a GPS antenna, see "miniPCIe slot usage" step 10. **Supports - GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo).**

Configuration information: [GPS basic examples](/docs/mobile-networking/gps#basic-examples).

The GPS uses an active antenna, connect only when power is turned off.

## Buttons and jumpers
