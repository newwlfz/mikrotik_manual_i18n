- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;

Please make sure to mount the device with the Ethernet ports facing down.

## Powering

The board accepts power from the power jack or from the first Ethernet port (Passive PoE):

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 8-30 V DC,
- The first Ethernet port accepts passive Power over Ethernet accepts 8-30 V DC.

The power consumption of this device is 2 W.

## Power output

This device can supply PoE powering to external devices from its Ethernet ports. This is convenient as you don't need any additional PoE injectors to power other devices. This feature is indicated by the letter "P" in the device model name. The output voltage will be the same as the input voltage, and this feature will have to be enabled on the specific ports in RouterOS software. By default it is disabled. The maximum power output of each Ethernet port in this mode is 1 A (2 A total for all ports). Once Power Output is enabled in RouterOS, the Ethernet LED light shines also in red. Red LED means the port is currently providing PoE power, green means Ethernet has a link, both at the same time means Ethernet is linked and power is being outputted.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Extension slots and ports

- Five individual Ethernet ports, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X), so you can use either straight or cross-over cables for connecting to other network devices.

## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Accessories

The package includes the following accessories that come with the device:

- IEC power cord.
- Steel clamp.
- PoE injector.
- 24 V power adapter.
- DIN mount.
