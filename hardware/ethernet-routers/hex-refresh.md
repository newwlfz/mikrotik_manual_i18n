## Quickstart

- Connect your ISP cable to the Ethernet1 port, and local network computers to ports 2-5;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Extension slots and ports

- Five 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet ports.
- One USB 2.0 type-A port.
- PoE-in on Ether1.

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Release the button when a green LED starts flashing, to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults.
- Release the button after LED is no longer lit to cause a device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network).

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Mode button

The action of the mode buttons can be configured from RouterOS software to execute any user-supplied RouterOS script. You can also disable this button. The mode button can be configured in RouterOS menu /system routerboard mode-button.
