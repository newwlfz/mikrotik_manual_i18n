- In the case of device failure, please disconnect it from power. The fastest way to do so is by unplugging the power plug from the power outlet.
- It is the customer's responsibility to follow local country regulations, including operation within legal frequency channels, output power, cabling requirements, and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) requirements. All MikroTik devices must be professionally installed.

## Quickstart

- Connect your ISP cable to the Ethernet1 port, and local network computers to the other ports;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure your network card with an address from the 192.168.88.0/24 network, because the device does not have a DHCP server enabled by default;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The device accepts powering from the dual/failover IEC power connectors on the back of the case. You can use either of them separately or both connectors at the same time, for failover purposes. The device also accepts 12-57V passive or 802.3af/at PoE on Ethernet port 13. The device also has a terminal block for Telecom -48V DC supply or any other DC supply in the 24-57 V range.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Booting process

First, the RouterBOOT loader is started. It displays boot information on the onboard RS232C asynchronous serial port. The serial port is set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.

The RouterOS system will then load. It will also be indicated by two beeps.

You can connect to the device with SSH, **WinBox**, or the web interface by plugging your computer into port Ether1 and connecting to 192.168.88.1 with the username "**admin**" and no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker). The device doesn't have a DHCP server enabled by default, your PC should be configured with an address from this network.

More information on connecting to the device: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help)

## Extension slots and ports

- 13x Gigabit Ethernet ports, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X), so you can use either straight or cross-over cables for connecting to other network devices. ETH13 port accepts PoE power, and can be used to boot the device from the network for reinstalling with the Netinstall utility (see documentation)
- DB9 RS232C asynchronous serial port
- microSD slot
- 2x M.2 slots, accepting SATA type M.2 SSD disks in 2280 form factor (only Dx4 model)
- 2x 2.5 inch SATA connectors, accepting standard 2.5" SATA HDD disks (only Dx4 model)

Recommended are SATA3 M.2 2242mm/2260mm/2280mm B+M key SSD disks with no capacity limitations.

## Reset button

The reset button has the following functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Or Keep holding the button for 5 more seconds until LED turns off, then release it to make the RouterBOARD look for Netinstall servers.

The bypass switch allows binding ports 11 and 12 together in bypass mode, which means that if the device loses power, the ports will be connected together, allowing data to pass from one port to the other, as if the device were not there.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
