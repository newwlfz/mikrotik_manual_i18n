## Quickstart

- Connect your Internet cable to the first port, and local network computers to the other ports;
- Choose your powering solution, please see Powering;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The power consumption under maximum load can reach 33 W. The device accepts power from the power jack or from the first Ethernet port:

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2.1 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 12-57 V DC.
- The First Ethernet port accepts Power over Ethernet 18-57 V DC.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE port of the PoE adapter;
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN to the LAN port of the PoE adapter, mind the arrows for data and power flow;
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and it can be mounted in a rackmount enclosure using provided rack mounts, or it can be placed on the desktop. Please attach rubber pegs on the bottom of the router if the desired placement is on the flat surface or use a Phillips screwdriver to attach rackmount ears on both sides of the device if designated use is for rackmount enclosure:

<p><Img src="/img/eb1f9b6b39ade041.webp" alt="" width={627} height={558} /></p>

- Attach rack ears to both sides of the device and tighten four screws to secure them in place;
- Place the device in a rackmount enclosure and align with the holes so that the device fits conveniently;
- Tighten screws to secure it in place.

The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment. We recommend Cat6 cables for our devices. *Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.*

Operating humidity can be from 5% to 95% non-condensing.

## Extension slots and ports

- The Ethernet ports are connected in two groups of five, each group is connected through a switch chip. The ports can be configured individually and support automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X), so you can use either straight or cross-over cables for connecting to other network devices.
- SFP+ port accepts SFP and SFP+ modules. Refer to the [MikroTik wired interface compatibility](/docs/7.24/wired-connections/mikrotik-wired-interface-compatibility) table.
- RJ45 console port for serial console access, set by default to 115200 bit/s, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity.

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Release the button when the green LED starts flashing, to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults.
- Release the button when the LED turns solid green to clear all configuration and bridge all interfaces.
- Release the button after LED is no longer lit (~20 seconds) to cause a device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network).

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Accessories

Package includes the following accessories that come with the device:

- EU/US Switching Power Supply DC ⎓ 24 V 1.5 A 36 W 87.4% VI 150 cm RA DC plug.
