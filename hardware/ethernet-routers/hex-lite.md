<p><Img src="/img/e8c99734ffbc0e6b.webp" alt="" width={592} height={504} /></p>

When mounting on the wall, please ensure that the cable feed is pointing downwards. We recommend using Cat5/6 cable for our devices. The IP rating scale for this device is IPX0.

## Powering

The board accepts power from the power jack or from the first Ethernet port (Passive PoE):

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 6-30 V DC;
- First Ethernet port accepts passive Power over Ethernet accepts 6-30 V DC. Normally the power consumption of this device is 2 W.

## Configuration

Once logged in, we recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button in the QuickSet menu, as updating your RouterOS software to the latest version ensures the best performance and stability. For wireless models, please make sure you have selected the country where the device will be used, to conform with local regulations.

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Extension slots and ports

- Five individual Ethernet ports, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X), so you can use either straight or cross-over cables for connecting to other network devices. The Ethernet port accepts 6-30 V DC power from a passive PoE injector, 12 V or more is recommended to compensate for the loss in cables.

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Release the button when green LED starts flashing, to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults.
- Release the button when the LED turns solid green to clear all configuration and bridge all interfaces.
- Release the button after LED is no longer lit (~20 seconds) to cause a device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network).

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
