## Quickstart

- Make sure your ISP is allowing hardware changes and will automatically issue an IP address;
- Connect your ISP cable to the first Ethernet port;
- Connect your PC to any of the Ethernet ports;
- Connect the device to the power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

- PoE-out: 802.3af/at, at the same voltage as supplied via the 2-pin terminal (passive PoE), or 802.3af/at compatible if a 44-57 V PSU is used.
- PoE-out ports: Ether1 - Ether8. Maximum output per port is 620 mA with input below 30 V and 420 mA with input above 30 V.
- Maximum total output: 2.59 A.
- Total output power: 130 W.
- Total output current: 2.28 A.
- Number of DC inputs: 2.
- Supported input voltage: 24-57 V (PoE-in) and 24-57 V (2-pin terminal).
- Maximum power consumption without attachments: 15 W.
- Maximum power consumption: 150 W.
- 2-pin terminal: Connector Plug P=5.08 mm 1x2pin RA TH, tin plated, 300 V 10 A.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Mounting

The device is designed for outdoor use and can be mounted on a wall or pole. Make sure the Ethernet ports face downwards.

We recommend Cat6 cables for our devices.

*The mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person. To comply with the **IP66** class, please observe the strict procedures in the mounting instructions.*

## Extension slots and ports

- Seven 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet ports with PoE-in and PoE-out.
- One 2.5G Ethernet port.
- One 10G SFP+ port.
- One USB 3.0 type-A port.

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Release the button when the green LED starts flashing, to reset the RouterOS configuration to defaults.
- Release the button after the LED is no longer lit (~20 seconds) to cause a device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network).

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## LED

- Hidden Green LED behind the Reset button is a USER LED
- Blue LED 1 is the DC1 Power LED
- Blue LED 2 is the DC2 Power LED
- Green SFP+ LED is an SFP+ port link and activity LED
- Ethernet RJ45 Green LEDs are Ethernet port link and activity LEDs
- Ethernet RJ45 Port 1 Orange LED is PoE-in status LED
- Ethernet RJ45 Port 2-8 Orange LEDs are unused on this model
