- Ultimate disposal of this product should be handled according to all national laws and regulations.
- The Installation of the equipment must comply with local and national electrical codes.
- This unit is intended to be installed in the rackmount. Please read the mounting instructions carefully before beginning installation. Failure to use the correct hardware or to follow the correct procedures could result in a hazardous situation to people and damage to the system.
- This product is intended to be installed indoors. Keep this product away from water, fire, humidity or hot environments.
- Use only the power supply and accessories approved by the manufacturer, and which can be found in the original packaging of this product.
- Read the installation instructions before connecting the system to the power source.
- We cannot guarantee that no accidents or damage will occur due to the improper use of the device. Please use this product with care and operate at your own risk!
- In the case of device failure, please disconnect it from power. The fastest way to do so is by unplugging the power plug from the power outlet.
- It is the customer's responsibility to follow local country regulations, including operation within legal frequency channels, output power, cabling requirements, and Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) requirements. All MikroTik devices must be professionally installed.

## Quickstart

- Connect your Internet cable to port 1, and local network computers to ports 2-10;
- Choose your powering solution, please see Powering;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The device accepts powering from either the power jack or from the LAN1 Ethernet port:

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside diameter, female, pin positive plug) accepts 8-30 V DC (overvoltage protection starts at 30 V).
- Eth1 port accepts 8-30 V DC input (at the board; higher voltage needed to compensate for power loss on long cables) from non-standard (passive) Power over Ethernet injectors. The board does not work with IEEE802.3af compliant 48 V power injectors.

Maximum power consumption 6 W, with attachments 18 W.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE port of the PoE adapter;
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN to the LAN port of the PoE adapter, mind the arrows for data and power flow;
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Power output

The PoE-out on Ether10 outputs approximately 2 V below the input voltage and supports up to 0.58 A, so the provided 24 V PSU will provide 22 V at 0.58 A output on the Ether10 PoE port.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and can be placed on the desktop, or you can mount it into rackmount using Phillips screwdriver to attach rackmount ears on both sides of the device:

- Attach rack ears to both sides of the device and tighten four screws to secure them in place;
- Place the device in rackmount enclosure and align with the holes so that the device fits conveniently;
- Tighten screws to secure it in place.

The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment. *Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.* Grounding screw is located on the backside of the device case, please connect it accordingly to efficient ground.

When mounting on the wall, please ensure that cable feed is pointing downwards. The IPX rating scale of this device is IPX0. We recommend using Cat6 shielded cables.

## Extension slots and ports

- Five 10/100/1000 (Gigabit) Ethernet ports (Auto MDI/X)
- Five 10/100 (Fast) Ethernet ports (Auto MDI/X)
- Ether10 supports 500 mA output power, ~2 V below the input voltage. Power-out supports auto-detect to protect non-PoE devices.
- 1G SFP port.
- USB slot type A.
- Serial port.
- LCD for configuration.

Please see the [MikroTik SFP module compatibility table](/docs/7.24/wired-connections/mikrotik-wired-interface-compatibility).

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Release the button when green LED starts flashing, to reset RouterOS configuration to defaults.
- Release the button when the LED turns solid green to clear all configuration and bridge all interfaces.
- Release the button after LED is no longer lit (~20 seconds) to cause a device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network).

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
