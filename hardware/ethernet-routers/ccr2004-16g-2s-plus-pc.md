## Quickstart

- Connect your PC to the **MGMT/BOOT** labeled port or the first Ethernet port;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure the IP settings of your network card to 192.168.88.2/24;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open 192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The device has dual integrated power supply units AC **⏦** 100-240V with standard IEC compatible sockets. Supported input voltage 36-57 V (DC jack) 36-57 (2-pin terminal) Power adapter nominal voltage 48 V Power adapter nominal current 0.9 A Max power consumption (without attachments) 30 W Max power consumption 36 W

## Configuration

The Ethernet port 15 has a default IP address for connecting: 192.168.88.1. The username is admin and there is no password. The device doesn't have any other configuration applied by default, please set up WAN IP addresses, user passwords, and update the device. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case the IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation, see the Reset button.

## Reset button

**Reset button**:

- Hold this button during boot time until the USER LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Hold the Reset button and power on your device (wait until the "USER" LED is blinking then stable "On", and when the "USER" LED is "Off" - release the Reset button) - the device is booting in BOOTP mode to reinstall RouterOS using [Netinstall](/docs/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall/). **The MGMT/BOOT Ethernet port is used for the Netinstall process.** See RouterOS documentation about using the Netinstall recovery utility.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Release the button before LED begins to flash, to only load backup RouterBOOT without resetting. This is useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
