## Quickstart

- Make sure your ISP allows hardware changes and will automatically issue an IP address;
- Connect your ISP cable to the first Ethernet port;
- Connect your PC to any of the Ethernet ports;
- Connect the device to the power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- In the "Quick Set" menu, choose your country to apply country regulation settings;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The power consumption under maximum load can reach 40 W. The device accepts power from the power jack or from the first Ethernet port:

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 24-56 V DC.
- The First Ethernet port accepts Power over Ethernet 802.3af/at.
- The 2-pin terminal on the side accepts 24-56 V DC.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE port of the PoE adapter;
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN to the LAN port of the PoE adapter, mind the arrows for data and power flow;
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and it can be mounted on the wall, or it can be placed on the desktop.

- Find the designed mounting holes on both sides of the device, as shown in the picture;
- Use provided screws to secure the device to the wall;
- Based on the wall material you can use a drill bit and provided dowels.

The device has no protection from water contamination, please ensure the placement of the device in a dry and ventilated environment. We recommend Cat6 cables for our devices. *The mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.*

## Rackmount

If desired placement is rackmount, additional brackets can be purchased separately:

## Reset button

The RouterBOOT reset button has the following functions. Press the button and apply the power, then:

- Release the button when the green LED starts flashing, to reset the RouterOS configuration to defaults.
- Release the button after LED is no longer lit (~20 seconds) to cause a device to look for Netinstall servers (required for reinstalling RouterOS over the network using Ether1).

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
