## Quickstart

- Make sure your ISP is accepting hardware changes and will automatically assign an IP address;
- Connect the ISP cable to the Ethernet1 port;
- Connect the PC to any port except Ethernet1;
- Connect the device to a power source;
- Configure your network card settings to obtain the IP address automatically using DHCP;
- Configuration should be made using **WebFig** in a web browser or the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox). **Multiple configuration methods are available to ensure accessibility;**
- Open https://192.168.88.1 in a web browser to start setup. If the IP address is unavailable, use **WinBox** and choose the "**Neighbors**" tab to find the device. Proceed to connect using the MAC address. The username is "**admin**", and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit mikrotik.com, select your model, and locate the required packages in the "Downloads" section;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WebFig** or **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device;
- Updating your RouterOS software to the latest version will ensure the best performance, stability, and security updates;
- Set up your router password.

## Powering

The power consumption under maximum load can reach 20 W. The device accepts power from the power jack or from the first Ethernet port:

- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 24-57 V DC.
- The first Ethernet port accepts Power over Ethernet 24-57 V DC.
- The 2-pin terminal on the side accepts 24-57 V DC.
- 2-pin terminal: Connector Plug P=5.08 mm 1x2pin RA TH, tin plated, 300 V 10 A.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the PoE port of the PoE adapter;
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN to the LAN port of the PoE adapter, mind the arrows for data and power flow;
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Configuration

RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting with the [RouterOS documentation](https://mt.lv/help) to get accustomed to the possibilities. In case an IP connection is not available, the **WinBox** tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Mounting

The device is designed to use indoors and it can be mounted on the wall, or it can be placed on the desktop.
