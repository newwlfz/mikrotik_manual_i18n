In the case of device failure, please disconnect it from power. The fastest way to do so is by unplugging the power adapter from the power outlet.

## Connecting

- Unlock the enclosure by simultaneously pressing the buttons located on both sides of the lower case, and then proceed to remove the cover from the device;
- Thread the cables through the rubber seal located on the underside of the case;
- Connect your desired network cable with power to the PoE in the Ethernet port, and extend it through the PoE out ports;
- Connect the cable to the next device or another GPER14i unit;

## Powering

This device offers two distinct power supply options:

- The First Ethernet port is a PoE-in that supports 802.3bt and accepts DC voltage in the range of 48 to 57V⎓.
- The two-pin connector is compatible with DC voltage in the range of 24 to 57V⎓.
- You can power up an additional GPER14i unit using the two-pin connector. To achieve this, connect the device to the two-pin connectors of another GPER14i unit, and ensure that the SwOS Lite System's "Power I/O" option is configured as "Output." To enable this operation, the device itself must be powered via PoE-in. Outgoing power WarningPlease ensure that the device's power consumption does not exceed the incoming power capacity of the power-feeding device, taking into account its current load.

Max power consumption: 115W. It is important to note that all other ports are limited to 30W power consumption
