## Quickstart

The configuration is the same as PTP Bridge in AP mode, wireless mode is set to AP for PTMP setups as well. The router can be accessed directly using the address. If the device is connected to the network with enabled DHCP server, configured DHCP client on the bridge interface will get the IP address, that can be used to access the router.

Please follow these quick steps to set up your device:

- Open the upper cover (see Removing upper and bottom covers);
- Connect an external antenna to the SMA connector (see Antenna usage);
- Open the bottom cover (see Removing upper and bottom covers);
- Connect your ISP cable to the device, make sure the ISP is allowing hardware change and will issue an automatic IP address;
- Connect the device to the power source (see Powering);
- Navigate to the network connections section on your computer and locate the wireless network named "*MikroTik-...*". Proceed to connect to it (check the wireless passwords on the sticker);
- Configuration should be made via a wireless network using a mobile application or you can use the **WinBox** configuration tool [https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox);
- Download and open **WinBox**, and choose the **Neighbors** tab to find the device;
- Click on the MAC address. The username is "**admin**" and there is no password (or, for some models, check user and wireless passwords on the sticker);
- For a manual update of the device, visit the products page at [https://mikrotik.com/products](https://mikrotik.com/products) to find your product. The required packages are accessible under the "Support&Downloads" menu;
- Upload downloaded packages to the **WinBox** "**Files**" menu and reboot the device. By upgrading your RouterOS software to the latest version, you can ensure optimal performance, stability, and security updates;
- In the wifi-interface menu set up the following: Choose your country, to apply country regulation settings; SSID; mode; See the manual page: [WiFi](/docs/wireless/wifi/)
- Set up your wireless network security profile;
- If you need to use a SIM card, open the case and install your desired modem into miniPCIe slot;
- Insert a Nano SIM card into the slot.

## Powering

The device accepts power in the following ways:

- Ethernet port accepts passive PoE, input voltage 18-28 V DC;
- Direct-input power jack (5.5 mm outside and 2 mm inside, female, pin positive plug) accepts 12-28 V DC.

The maximum power consumption without attachments is 12 W, and under maximum load it can reach 25 W.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

## Mounting

The NetMetal ax is designed to be used outdoors and mounted on pole or DIN rail.

When mounting, please ensure that cable feed is pointing downwards. The IP rating scale of this device is IP66. We recommend using Cat6 shielded cables. Warning! This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the device and your body. Operation of this equipment in the residential environment could cause radio interference. Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person. The mounting hose clamp is provided with the package.

![](/img/888d0d7f203dd8db.webp)

- Guide hose clamp through the opening on the back of the device.
- Attach to the pole or mast.
- Align and secure by hose clamp screw using PH2 screwdriver.
- The device should be always placed by TOP cover facing upwards.

Please secure all loose Ethernet cables and antenna cables to the pole or mast approximately 30cm from the device, so that the cable weight is not pulling the ports and connectors.

## Front status LED behavior

RouterOS allows configuring each LED's activity the way that the user wishes. It is possible to configure the LEDs to display wireless strength, blink the LEDs on interface traffic activity and many other options. See the [LEDs](/docs/hardware/leds) page for further information. Default factory configuration for this device:

![](/img/526195de166b417d.webp)

- Solid Blue – The device is powered on.
- Solid Green – Active SFP port.
- Solid Green – Active Ethernet port.
- Solid Green – The set of five green LEDs, shows the signal strength.

## Configuration

The device is configured as a wireless access point, with the Ethernet port configured as a DHCP client, for connecting to your ISP router or switch. A DHCP server is configured on the wireless interface. We recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button in the QuickSet menu, as updating your RouterOS software to the latest version ensures the best performance and stability. For wireless models, please make sure you have selected the country where the device will be used, to conform with local regulations. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation, see a section Reset button.
