The SXT device has a sliding door, behind which the Ethernet ports and the reset buttons are located. This door can be also secured shut with a screw in the provided screw hole. When using both Ethernet ports, make sure to cut a wider cable opening in the plastic door. You can use pliers to tear out the plastic piece that is protecting the cable opening. When closing the plastic door, make sure to apply pressure, until it "clicks" into place. *Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.*

## Grounding

The installation infrastructure (towers and masts), as well as the router itself, must be properly grounded. The device includes a grounding wire attachment connector behind the case door. Attach your grounding wire to the grounding connector, then attach the other end of the grounding wire to the grounded mast. This is to substantially reduce the risk of ESD and lightning damage.

## Extension slots and ports
