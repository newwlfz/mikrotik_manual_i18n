## Configuration

Once logged in, we recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button in the QuickSet menu, as updating your RouterOS software to the latest version ensures the best performance and stability. For wireless models, please make sure you have selected the country where the device will be used, to conform with local regulations. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case an IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation, see the Buttons and jumpers.

## Buttons and jumpers

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Keep holding the reset button until the LED turns solid, then release it to enable CAP mode. The device will then start searching for a CAPsMAN server.
- To reinstall RouterOS using the [Netinstall](/docs/7.24/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall/) utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. Two booter options are available: the **Regular Booter** and the **Backup Booter**. It is recommended to verify both options in case one does not work.

- **Regular Booter:** To enter etherboot mode, press the **Reset** button after powering on the device and waiting 1–2 seconds.
- **Backup Booter:** Power off the device. Press and hold the **Reset** button, then power on the device. Wait for the **LED** sequence (blinking → steady → off), then release the button. The device will boot into **BOOTP** mode, ready for RouterOS reinstallation via **Netinstall**. Depending on the model, this may be indicated by the **USR, USER, System**, or **ACT** LED, or by the SFP port LED.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Operating system support

The device supports RouterOS v7 and above. The specific factory-installed version is listed in /system resource. Other operating systems have not been tested.
