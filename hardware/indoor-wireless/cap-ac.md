<p><Img src="/img/d33fa6faeea2ff7d.webp" alt="" width={679} height={455} /></p>

## Powering

The device accepts power from the Ethernet port, so you must either use the included passive PoE injector or make sure your switch supports passive or 802.3af/at PoE output.

- Ethernet port accepts 12-57 V DC **⎓** (802.3af/at or passive PoE). The power consumption under maximum load can reach 13 W.

### Connecting to a PoE Adapter

- Connect the Ethernet cable from the device to the POE port of the POE adapter.
- Connect an Ethernet cable from your LAN to the LAN port of the POE adapter, please mind arrows for data and power flow.
- Connect the power cord to the adapter, and then plug the power cord into a power outlet.

## Mounting

It is possible to attach the device to a wall or ceiling, using the provided mounting bracket on the back of the unit:

- Attach the mounting bracket to the wall or ceiling with provided three screws;
- Use 5 mm drill bit if necessary with provided dowels;

<p><Img src="/img/4f5fb86cf27278d8.webp" alt="" width={451} height={365} /></p>

- Connect needed cables to the device;
- If needed second mounting bracket can be used for additional support when working on thin ceilings or walls, provided screw length is 20 mm;
- Attach the second mount to the other side of the ceiling and secure with screws through the first mount;
- Attach the device to the mounting bracket and turn clockwise until the device secures in place; *Mounting and configuration of this device should be done by a qualified person.* Warning! This equipment should be installed and operated with a minimum distance of 20 cm between the device and your body. Operation of this equipment in the residential environment could cause radio interference.

Operating humidity can be from 5% to 95% non-condensing.

## Configuration

By default, the device is configured as a wireless access point, with the first ethernet port (Eth1) configured as a DHCP client, and the second interface bridged together with the wireless interface. A DHCP server is configured on the bridge interface. Once logged in, we recommend clicking the "Check for updates" button in the QuickSet menu, as updating your RouterOS software to the latest version ensures the best performance and stability. For wireless models, please make sure you have selected the country where the device will be used, to conform with local regulations. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device from the network, see the Reset button.

## Extension slots and ports

- Two 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports, supporting automatic cross/straight cable correction (Auto MDI/X). Either straight or crossover cable can be used for connecting to other network devices. The Eth2 port is capable of powering another RouterBOARD device with passive PoE (up to 57 V). The maximum output current is 500mA when using less than 30V to power this device and 400mA when using more than 30V.
- Integrated Wireless 2.4 GHz 802.11b/g/n, supports AP/CPE/P2P/repeater modes.
- Integrated Wireless 5 GHz 802.11a/n/ac.

## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Keep holding the reset button until the LED turns solid, then release it to enable CAP mode. The device will then start searching for a CAPsMAN server.
- To reinstall RouterOS using the [Netinstall](/docs/7.24/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall/) utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. Two booter options are available: the **Regular Booter** and the **Backup Booter**. It is recommended to verify both options in case one does not work.

- **Regular Booter:** To enter etherboot mode, press the **Reset** button after powering on the device and waiting 1–2 seconds.
- **Backup Booter:** Power off the device. Press and hold the **Reset** button, then power on the device. Wait for the **LED** sequence (blinking → steady → off), then release the button. The device will boot into **BOOTP** mode, ready for RouterOS reinstallation via **Netinstall**. Depending on the model, this may be indicated by the **USR, USER, System**, or **ACT** LED, or by the SFP port LED.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.

## Mode button

There are two mode buttons on this unit, but they both are performing the same action. The action of the mode buttons can be configured from RouterOS software to execute any user-supplied RouterOS script. You can also disable this button. By default, the buttons will enable "dark mode", which disables beeps and LED lights. The mode button can be configured in the RouterOS menu /system routerboard mode-button.

## LED indicators

There are seven LED lights on the unit, which can be disabled altogether if necessary.

- User – user-configurable led for any desired script.
- 5G – 5GHz interface activity.
- 2G – 2.4 GHz interface activity.
- E2 – Ethernet 2 connected.
- E1 – Ethernet 1 connected.
- PoE LED indicates that the ETH2 port is currently powering another device with PoE.
- The power LED indicates that the unit is receiving power in the ETH1 port.
