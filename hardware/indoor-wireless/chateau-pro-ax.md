## Configuration

We recommend checking for updates frequently to receive the latest updates for your RouterOS software to ensure the best performance and stability. RouterOS includes many configuration options in addition to what is described in this document. We suggest starting here to get yourself accustomed to the possibilities: [https://mt.lv/help](https://mt.lv/help) In case an IP connection is not available, the WinBox tool ([https://mt.lv/winbox](https://mt.lv/winbox)) can be used to connect to the MAC address of the device from the LAN side (all access is blocked from the Internet port by default). For recovery purposes, it is possible to boot the device for reinstallation, see the Reset button.

## Mode button

The mode button is located on the back of the unit, on the right side. The Default configuration for the Mode button is dark mode - to turn off all LEDs. The button can be configured in RouterOS to run any user-specified scripts.

## Sync button

The sync button is located on the top of the unit. WPS Sync button, if configured on the wireless interface, can be used to connect new clients.

## Reset button

The reset button has three functions:

- Hold this button during boot time until the green LED light starts flashing, release the button to reset RouterOS configuration.
- Keep holding the reset button until the LED turns solid, then release it to enable CAP mode. The device will then start searching for a CAPsMAN server.
- To reinstall RouterOS using the [Netinstall](/docs/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/netinstall/) utility, enter the device into BOOTP mode. Two booter options are available: the **Regular Booter** and the **Backup Booter**. It is recommended to verify both options in case one does not work.

- **Regular Booter:** To enter etherboot mode, press the **Reset** button after powering on the device and waiting 1–2 seconds.
- **Backup Booter:** Power off the device. Press and hold the **Reset** button, then power on the device. Wait for the **LED** sequence (blinking → steady → off), then release the button. The device will boot into **BOOTP** mode, ready for RouterOS reinstallation via **Netinstall**. Depending on the model, this may be indicated by the **USR, USER, System**, or **ACT** LED, or by the SFP port LED.

Regardless of the above option used, the system will load the backup RouterBOOT loader if the button is pressed before power is applied to the device. Useful for RouterBOOT debugging and recovery.
