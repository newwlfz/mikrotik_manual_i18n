-

A new window will appear and you will have to enter: Name: (Server name) Address: (Server address) Up port: (for LoRa UDP, 1700) Down port: (for LoRa UDP, 1700)

-

Click OK to save. **Second step:**

-

Select the Device tab on the previous window.

-

Double-click or tap on the line to configure.

-

Choose the previously entered network on the drop-down menu.

## Specifications

The module can be installed on the miniPCIe to USB adapter and used in any of our devices with a USB slot and installed Lora package.

**To use the module in other devices packet forwarder from Semtech is required:** [packet_forwarder](https://github.com/Lora-net/packet_forwarder)

This warning only applies to mPCIe cards that are already preinstalled in MikroTik gateway devices, like WAP LR9. It is important to note here, that using **pins 39** and **41**is mandatory. If you want to use the card elsewhere, note that some USB to mPCIe adapters do not have mentioned pins connected and, without them, the LoRa card will not work. For a more detailed **pinout**, check the section below.
