### Settings menu

Hold (3 s) the button from the home screen to open the settings menu. The menu contains the following items:

- Pairing code
- Temperature unit
- VOC unit for Matter
- Unpairing
- CO₂ sensor calibration
- Display settings
- Back (exit)

Tap (50 ms – 1 s) cycles through the settings items; hold (1 s) to confirm an item. If no input is registered for 30 seconds, the screen automatically reverts to the main layout.

#### Pairing code

Navigate to **Pairing code** and hold (1 s). The screen displays the Matter QR pairing code. Hold (1 s), or wait for the 30-second timeout, to return to the main screen.

#### Temperature unit

Navigate to **Temperature unit** and hold (1 s). Choose Celsius (°C), Fahrenheit (°F), or Back. Hold (1 s) to save the unit and return to the main screen.

#### VOC unit for Matter

Navigate to **VOC unit for Matter** and hold (1 s). Choose ppm, µg/m³, or Back. Hold (1 s) to confirm and return to the main screen.

:::note note

The VOC unit can affect how the air quality data is displayed on different platforms. When using the **Google Home** app, use **ppm**. When using the **Apple HomePod** and **Amazon Alexa** apps, use **µg/m³**.

:::

#### Unpairing

Navigate to **Unpairing** and hold (1 s); the screen will show "Ready to unpair BLE/Matter".

- If the 30-second timeout expires, the screen reverts back without unpairing.
- Tap (50 ms – 3 s) to unpair; the screen confirms success. Wait for the 5-second timeout or tap to go back.

:::note note

If the **Claire** has been paired to some other home already, do not forget to **Unpair** it, as it can prevent new pairing.

:::

#### CO₂ sensor calibration

Navigate to **CO₂ sensor calibration** and hold (1 s). Place the device in fresh air (~400 ppm CO₂) and wait 60 seconds. When prompted to start calibration, tap (50 ms – 3 s) to confirm (3-minute timeout reverts back). Wait while the calibration completes; the system reboots automatically.

#### Display settings

Navigate to **Display settings** and hold (1 s) to access screen preferences:

-

**Display anti-burn in** – Select **Display anti-burn in** (hold 1 s). Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle **Enabled** or **Disabled** (Default = **Disabled**) or (go) Back. Hold (1 s) to save selection. This feature is meant for devices running 24/7 in bright light: every 15 minutes it briefly refreshes the display (a few seconds) to reduce burn-in. In normal use the brightness auto-adjusts and dims at night, so burn-in is unlikely and the feature is off by default.

-

**Display brightness** – Select **Display brightness** (hold 1 s). Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle between **Automatic** (adjusts via ambient light sensor) or **Manual** (Default = **Automatic**) or (go) Back. Hold (1 s) to choose the selection. Under **Manual** you can tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle between **Set brightness** and **Night mode** (or go Back). Hold (1 s) to select your choice:

- **Set brightness** – Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle between **2%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%** (or go Back).
- **Night mode** – Tap (50 ms – 1 s) to toggle **ON** or **OFF** (or go Back). **ON** uses the set brightness but drops to 2% in dark environments; **OFF** keeps the set brightness regardless of darkness. Hold (1 s) to confirm selection.

-

**Back** – Select **Back** and hold (1 s) to return to the device settings list.

#### Exit Menu

Select **Back** and hold (1 s) to return to the main screen.

## Mounting instruction

- To mount the device on a wall and supply power via the DC terminal, remove the small cover using a flat-head screwdriver or a utility knife. Ensure correct polarity when connecting the DC power wires. Do not reverse the polarity.
- Use the supplied mounting template to mark the required drill holes for the wall bracket and, if needed, the cable entry hole.

- Position 1 – mounting with the security screw (recommended for public installations). Use two screws at the sides for fixation.
- Position 2 – mounting without the security screw.

- For concrete or brick surfaces, drill the holes using a 5 mm drill bit.
- Install the mounting bracket: insert wall plugs, align the bracket, insert the screws, and tighten firmly.
- Attach the device to the mounting bracket.
- For public installations, secure the device using the included security screw. Use a T9 Torx drive bit to tighten the screw.
